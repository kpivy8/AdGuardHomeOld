## AdGuard Home OpenAPI

We are using [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) to generate AdGuard Home API specification.

### How to edit the API spec

The easiest way would be to use [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) and just copy/paste the YAML file there.

### How to read the API doc

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. Open `http://localhost:4000/`
